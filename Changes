0.010		2013-08-05	T. R. Wyant
  Get rid of Regexp alias qr{^rad50$}i, which is unneeded, and seems not
    to work as advertised.
  Modernize the eg/ scripts.

0.009		2012-01-06	T. R. Wyant
  Make Changes file comply with Test::CPAN::Changes, and add author test
    xt/author/changes.t to be sure it stays that way.

0.008		2011-12-17	T. R. Wyant
  Recover author test xt/author/manifest.t, which was clobbered shortly
    before the release of 0.007.

0.007		2011-12-01	T. R. Wyant
  Convert most tests to Test::More. Require Test::More 0.88 for build.
  Update GNU GPL in LICENSES/Copying to have current FSF address.

0.006		2011-10-31	T. R. Wyant
  No changes, other than version.

0.005_90	2011-10-20	T. R. Wyant
  Reorganize tests into distribution tests (t/*) and author tests
    (xt/author/*). The POD tests go the latter place, plus new Perl
    Critic and executable-bit tests. Author tests require Module::Build.
  Eliminate prototypes on encode() and decode(). They probably weren't
    doing anything anyway, since prototypes are ignored on method calls.
  Require Perl 5.006 (for 'our'). Add strictures
  Eliminate use of string eval to load modules.
  Redid declared dependencies to reflect reality.
  Eliminate unused variables.
  Fixed warning on uninitialized $written variable.
  Update to Perl-Foundation-Recommended license and copyright wording.

0.005		2007-09-16	T. R. Wyant
  Rewrite t/basic.t again to use PerlIO, since ActivePerl still
    had trouble with 0.004.
  Update copyright.
  Add explicit license statement.
  Remove shebang lines from Build.PL, t/*.t, and make sure not
    executable.

0.004		2006-10-24	T. R. Wyant
  Eliminate use of File::Temp in t/basic.t, since some ActivePerls
    seem to have trouble with it. No other changes.

0.003		2006-09-30	T. R. Wyant
  Acknowledge help finding more uses for RAD50 (Brian), and
    cvt syntax (Nora Narum).
  Restructure kit (to lib/Encode/RAD50.pm).
  Add Build.PL.
  Add examples.

0.002		2005-10-15	T. R. Wyant
  I decide to play the CPANTS game. No change to functionality.

0.001		2005-02-26	T. R. Wyant
  Initial release to CPAN.
