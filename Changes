  No changes, other than version.

0.005_90	20-Oct-2011	T. R. Wyant
  Reorganize tests into distribution tests (t/*) and author tests
    (xt/author/*). The POD tests go the latter place, plus new Perl
    Critic and executable-bit tests. Author tests require Module::Build.
  Eliminate prototypes on encode() and decode(). They probably weren't
    doing anything anyway, since prototypes are ignored on method calls.
  Require Perl 5.006 (for 'our'). Add strictures
  Eliminate use of string eval to load modules.
  Redid declared dependencies to reflect reality.
  Eliminate unused variables.
  Fixed warning on uninitialized $written variable.
  Update to Perl-Foundation-Recommended license and copyright wording.

0.005		16-Sep-2007	T. R. Wyant
  Rewrite t/basic.t again to use PerlIO, since ActivePerl still
    had trouble with 0.004.
  Update copyright.
  Add explicit license statement.
  Remove shebang lines from Build.PL, t/*.t, and make sure not
    executable.

0.004		24-Oct-2006	T. R. Wyant
  Eliminate use of File::Temp in t/basic.t, since some ActivePerls
    seem to have trouble with it. No other changes.

0.003		30-Sep-2006	T. R. Wyant
  Acknowledge help finding more uses for RAD50 (Brian), and
    cvt syntax (Nora Narum).
  Restructure kit (to lib/Encode/RAD50.pm).
  Add Build.PL.
  Add examples.
