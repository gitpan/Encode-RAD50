 0.001 26-Feb-2005 T. R. Wyant
       Initial release to CPAN.
 0.002 15-Oct-2005 T. R. Wyant
       I decide to play the CPANTS game. No change to functionality.
 0.003 30-Sep-2006 T. R. Wyant
       Acknowledge help finding more uses for RAD50 (Brian), and
       cvt syntax (Nora Narum).
       Restructure kit (to lib/Encode/RAD50.pm).
       Add Build.PL.
       Add examples.
 0.004 24-Oct-2006 T. R. Wyant
       Eliminate use of File::Temp in t/basic.t, since some ActivePerls
       seem to have trouble with it. No other changes.
 0.005 16-Sep-2007 T. R. Wyant
       Rewrite t/basic.t again to use PerlIO, since ActivePerl still
       had trouble with 0.004.
       Update copyright.
       Add explicit license statement.
       Remove shebang lines from Build.PL, t/*.t, and make sure not
       executable.
