Convert::Rad50

This piece of retrocomputing converts between ASCII subset and Rad50,
an encoding only used, to the best of my knowledge, for the Digital
(R.I.P.) PDP-11 computer, under (at least) the RSX-11 (including IAS and
P/OS), RT-11, RSTS (-11 and /E)  operating systems.

There are two subroutines/methods (depending on whether you call them
directly or not): encode and decode. Nothing is exported by default,
since both names strike me as candidates for collision.

This module is installable by the usual incantation:

    gunzip Convert-Rad50-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf Convert-Rad50-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
Rad50.pm in the Convert directory in the appropriate place in your
@INC directories.

See the eg directory for samples.

I have no idea what anyone would want to use this for.
