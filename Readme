Convert::Rad50 version 0.001This piece of retrocomputing converts between ASCII subset and Rad50,an encoding used on at least the RSX-11 and RT-11 operating systems.There are two subroutines/methods (depending on whether you call themdirectly or not): encode and decode. Nothing is exported by default,since both names strike me as candidates for collision.This module is installable by the usual incantation:    gunzip Convert-Rad50-9.999.tar.gz    tar -xf Convert-Rad50-9.999.tar    perl Makefile.PL    make    make test    make installOf course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and dropRad50.pm in the Convert directory in the appropriate place in your@INC directories.I have no idea what anyone would want to use this for.Tom Wyant
