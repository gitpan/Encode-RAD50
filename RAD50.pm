=head1 NAME

Encode::RAD50 - Convert to and from the Rad50 character set.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Encode;
 use Encode::RAD50; # Sorry about this.
 $rad50 = encode ('RAD50', 'FOO');
 $ascii = decode ('rad50', pack 'n', 10215);
 binmode STDOUT, ':encoding(rad50)'; # Perverse, but it works.
 print 'A#C'; # Gives a warning, since '#' isn't valid.

Because this is not a standard encoding, you will need to explicitly

 use Encode::RAD50;

Though of course the name of the module is case-sensitive, the name
of the encoding (passed to encode (), decode (), or ":encodingZ<>()")
is not case-sensitive.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package is designed to convert to and from the Rad50 character
set. It's really a piece of retrocomputing, since this character set
was, to the best of my knowledge, only used for the Digital (R.I.P.)
PDP-11 computer, under (at least) the RSX-11 and RT-11 operating
systems.

Rad50 is a way to squeeze three characters into two bytes, by
restricting the character set to upper-case 7-bit ASCII letters,
digits, space, "." and "$". There is also an encoding for what was
called "the illegal character." In the language of the Encode modules
this is the substitution character, and its ASCII representation is
"?".

When more than three characters are encoded, the first three go in the
first two bytes, the second three in the second two, and so on.

If you try to encode some number of characters other than a multiple of
three, implicit spaces will be added to the right-hand end of the string.
These will become explicit when you decode.

The astute observer will note that the character set does not have 50
characters. To which I reply that it does, if you count the invalid
character and if your "50" is octal.

The test suite was verified using the RSX-11M+ "CVT" command. But the
CVT command interprets "A" as though it were "E<nbsp>E<nbsp>A" (i.e.
leading spaces), whereas this module interprets it as "AE<nbsp>E<nbsp>"
(i.e. trailing spaces).

Nothing is actually exported by this package. The "encode" and "decode"
in the synopsis come from the L<Encode> package.

It is not clear to me that the PerlIO support is completely correct.
But the test suite passes under cygwin, darwin, MSWin32, and VMS (to
identify them by the contents of $^O).

#	_carp ($check, ...)

#	already croaked!), and returns true if RETURN_ON_ERR is set.
#	It is not part of the public interface to this module, and the

This is the decode method documented in L<Encode::Encoding>. Though you
B<can> call it directly, the anticipated mechanism is via the decode
subroutine exported by Encode.

}

=item $old_val = Encode::RAD50->silence_warnings ($new_val)

This class method causes Encode::RAD50 to ignore the WARN_ON_ERR
flag. This is primarily for testing purposes, meaning that I couldn't
figure out any other way to supress the warnings when testing the
handling of invalid characters in PerlIO.

If the argument is true, warnings are not generated even if the caller
specifies the WARN_ON_ERROR flag. If the argument is false, warnings
are generated if the caller specifies WARN_ON_ERROR. Either way, the
previous value is returned.

If no argument is passed, you get the current setting. The initial
setting is false.

=cut

sub silence_warnings {
my $old = !($chk_mod & WARN_ON_ERR);
@_ and $chk_mod = $_[0] ?
    $chk_mod & ~WARN_ON_ERR :
    $chk_mod | WARN_ON_ERR;
$old;
}

=head1 BUGS

Perlqq, HTML charref, and XML charref fallback modes are not supported,
because the RAD50 character set does not have the necessary characters.
In plainer language, you can't stick a backslash in the output stream
if the backslash is an invalid character. Requests for these fallback
modes will be ignored, and the replacement character inserted.
