This directory contains examples of the use of Encode::RAD50:

cvt
        This is a re-implementation of the RSX-11 command of the same
	name. It demonstrates the use of Encode::RAD50 via the
	encode() and decode() methods of the Encode package.

irad50
        This is a Unix filter which converts ASCII on STDIN into RAD50
	on STDOUT. It demonstrates the use of Encode::RAD50 as a PerlIO
	layer, and requires a PerlIO-enabled Perl. It takes the
	following options:
	    -help (guess what);
	    -quiet (supresses invalid character warnings);
	    -uppercase (converts input to uppercase before encoding).

r50asc
	This is a Unix filter which converts RAD50 on STDIN into ASCII
	on STDOUT. No help is provided.
